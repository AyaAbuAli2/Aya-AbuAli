### 🌟 My Journey

I graduated with a degree in Software Engineering, though my passion was never strictly programming.

During my studies, I started an online store that brought me social balance and allowed me to explore my love for variety and new experiences — I’ve never liked fixed routines.

After graduation, I worked at a public service office doing print jobs, but soon realized my mind and abilities were meant for greater challenges.

I believe my community needs people who can contribute in impactful ways, which motivated me to return to learning — this time focusing on **Quality Assurance**.

Since then, I've dedicated myself to mastering QA, driven by the belief that quality is the cornerstone of successful software and better user experiences.

### 🎨 Beyond Coding

I enjoy balancing technical work with creativity — like crafting candy bouquets.  
I thrive on trying new things, breaking the mold, and solving complex puzzles.  
Psychological balance is key in my personal and professional life.
